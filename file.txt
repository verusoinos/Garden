There's a lesson that I need to remember When everything is falling apart In life, just like in loving There's such a thing as trying too hard You've gotta sing Like you don't need the money Love like you'll never get hurt You've gotta dance Like nobody's watching It's gotta come from the heart If you want it to work. -- Kathy Mattea

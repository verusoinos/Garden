Difficult Paths With but a small understanding One may follow the Way like a main road, Fearing only to leave it; Following a main road is easy, Yet people delight in difficult paths. When palaces are kept up Fields are left to weeds And granaries empty; Wearing fine clothes, Bearing sharp swords, Glutting with food and drink, Hoarding wealth and possessions - These are the ways of theft, And far from the Way. -- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
